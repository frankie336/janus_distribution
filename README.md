Janus 0.1 is  converts Cisco Virl topologies to GNS3 projects. It can quickly load all published INE ( Internetworking Experts) CCIE topologies and load the correct initial configs. 

This initial release is for Linux Ubuntu computers. A Windows version will be published soon . 

At the time of writing,  it converts 195 individual INE labs including the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure v1.0 ; which is the replacement for the Routing and Switching track. To be clear, these are the same labs and initial configs tied to the various courses offered by INE . 

Many Engineers prefer GNS3 over Cisco Virl. Using Janus1.0 will save the CCIE candidate many hours if time and some expense in renting or buying equipment.
